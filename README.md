# Hyphare:Automated_Mushroom_Grow_Kit

Name: Hyphae - Making growing boutique mushrooms simple and sustainable

Problem Statement

The pandemic caused a surge of people gardening and focusing on healthy eating. Data suggests that this trend was structural and not cyclical to only 2020. Blog posts from Food Print also show growing interest in home chefs and gardeners who want to grow exotic mushroom species that can not easily or affordably be bought in traditional supermarkets. The current ways for mushroom growers to get exotic mushrooms are to either hunt for them in the wild, which can be dangerous, or grow them in simple grow kits that have unsuitable environments.
 In recent years, there has been a buzz around the idea of automated mushroom grow kits. However, the machines that are currently for sale are big and bulky and would never blend into most kitchen settings. When it comes to the more traditional kits that are low-tech, users can have issues growing mushrooms for the reasons below. Overall, this enumerated the need for a simple, small, and sustainable automated mushroom growing kit in order to capture this underserved market.

Not enough moisture 
Too much moisture because their is not enough drainage 
Not sterile enough
Not enough air exchange because mushrooms need oxygen since they are more similar to animals than plants 
Wrong temperature 
Lack of Patience 

Project Concept

For this project, I decided to build an automated mushroom grow kit that will allow users to simply put in their organic cellulose-based food waste plus some spores to produce a mushroom automatically after a few weeks. I wanted to make the experience as frictionless as possible so that this could be an item in everyoneâ€™s kitchen. This version of the machine will only grow Oyster Mushrooms for now since they are an easy and delicious species that most people are familiar with. When the user gets the device, they must slide up the lid and place their material inside. Then, they will have to fill up the humidifier section with water. After that, they will close the machine and turn it on. When this happens, the glass on the front of the machine will go clear, and it will start measuring the environment and adjusting it to best suit the needs of the mushroom species being grown at the time. The machine will keep humidifying for this test case with the Blue Oyster Mushroom species until the air has reached 80 percent humidity. The machine will also have front opaque for seven days while the mycelium colonizes the cellulose-based medium. After that, the light will turn on to encourage the mushroom to fruit. 

Oyster Mushroom Research

Blue Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus var. columbinus) are native and adapted to central Virginia. They often grow near trees in subtropical and temperate forests since they decompose wood. They prefer oak and beech tree wood and shaded areas. Most Oyster mushroom species like to grow between 64 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit, but Blue Oyster mushrooms can propagate at cooler temperatures. It can take 7 to 21 days for the spores to be placed in the cellulose-based medium to colonize the medium. Signs of green or discoloration in the medium show that another species has colonized the substance, and the process will need to be restarted. Blue light is a key factor that tells mushrooms to produce a fruiting body. The specific wavelength is 450 nanometers.
